Goal of this project is to create a sqlite database of all pictures and
videos created by a digital camera and stored on a customers hard-drive

Entire code base is written in python 2.7 using visual studio plugins for 
python development
code makes use of perl exifTool tool written by Phil Harvey to extract
metadata generated by digital cameras and the python wrapper for exiftool
customer needs to update the python installation with point to the
wrapper(or place it in python installation directory)

Perl exiftool is included in this kit(and pointed to by the
application)

The customer drives the application by selecting the hard-drives to scan
for files and choose the location of the sqlite DB

Future roadmap for this project is:
a. Photo-viewer(wpf based) based on sqlite DB
b. Duplicate file finder based on sqlite DB
c. web-based services to access photos
d. photo life-cycle management
e. remove irrelevant metadata from table

SQLITE DB details
File Metadata Tables are generated, one for each year(2005,2006)
All exif tags,riff tags(videos) and file tags are processed.
No distinction(yet) is made for photos and videos (they are stored
in the same table)
The table column is determined based on the initial file search path.
new columns are not appended to the table based on newer file meta data.
